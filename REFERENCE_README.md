<br>

Play any Sea Power scenario head-to-head with a friend. One player hosts, the other connects, and you're in. Both instances run their own units authoritatively, with game state synced over UDP or Steam P2P.

### How combat works

Combat is resolved by the **target** of the engagement. If Player A fires a missile at Player B, then Player B's game decides the outcome. If B's air defence intercepts it, that result syncs to A. If the missile hits, both sides see the hit. When the two instances disagree, the target's outcome is always final.

## Getting Started

There are three ways to install the mod. Pick whichever suits you best.

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)</b></summary>

The launcher handles everything automatically - it installs BepInEx, copies the plugin, and launches the game.

1. Download **SeapowerMultiplayer.Launcher.exe** from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Run the launcher.
3. It will auto-detect your Sea Power installation, install BepInEx if needed, and copy the plugin DLL into the correct folder.
4. Click **Launch** to start the game with the mod loaded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Manual DLL Install</b></summary>

If you prefer to manage things yourself:

1. Download and install **[BepInEx 5.4.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)** into your Sea Power game directory.
   - Extract the BepInEx zip so that `BepInEx/` sits alongside `Sea Power.exe`.
   - Run the game once to let BepInEx generate its folder structure, then close it.
2. Download **SeapowerMultiplayer.dll** from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
3. Copy the DLL into `Sea Power/BepInEx/plugins/`.
4. Launch the game normally.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 3: Build from Source</b></summary>

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malfboi/SeaPowerMultiplayerMod.git
   ```
2. Make sure **BepInEx 5.4.x** is installed in your game directory (see Option 2 above).
3. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/SeapowerMultiplayer.csproj
   ```
   If your game is not installed in the default Steam location, specify the path:
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/SeapowerMultiplayer.csproj /p:GameDir="D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Sea Power"
   ```
   The build automatically copies the DLL and its dependencies into `BepInEx/plugins/`.

</details>

## How to Play

### Via Steam (easiest)

1. Launch the game with the mod installed.
2. Open a mission.
3. Press **Ctrl+F9** to open the multiplayer overlay.
4. Click **Host Lobby**.
5. Click **Invite Friend** and send a Steam invite.
6. Your friend accepts and is automatically connected and synced into the mission.

### Via Direct Connect

1. Launch the game with the mod installed.
2. Press **Ctrl+F9** to open the multiplayer overlay (top-right corner).
3. **Host:** Open a mission, then click **Start Hosting**. Default port is `7777`.
4. **Client:** Enter the host's IP address, then click **Connect**.
5. Once connected, the host clicks **Send Scene to Client** to sync the scenario.

The client automatically receives and loads the host's save - no need to manually load the same mission.

### In-Game Controls

Both players use the normal game controls. In PvP, both sides are authoritative for their own units. In co-op, the host's game is authoritative and client orders are sent to the host for execution.

| Action | Shortcut | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Open multiplayer overlay | `Ctrl+F9` | Host, connect, invite, send scene |
| Force resync | `Ctrl+F10` | Either player can trigger this |
| Time controls | Normal keys | Synced - host decides and broadcasts the result |

<br>

## Configuration

The mod generates a config file at `BepInEx/config/SeapowerMultiplayer.cfg` on first launch.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `IsHost` | `true` | Run as host (server) or client |
| `HostIP` | `127.0.0.1` | IP to connect to (client only) |
| `Port` | `7777` | UDP port (must match on both sides) |
| `AutoConnect` | `false` | Automatically host/connect on game launch |
| `TransportType` | `LiteNetLib` | Network transport - `LiteNetLib` or `Steam` |

### Network Requirements

| Transport | Port Forwarding | Details |
|-----------|:-:|---------|
| **LiteNetLib (UDP)** | Required | Host must open port `7777` (or configured port) for UDP. Both players need a direct network path (LAN, port forwarding, or VPN). |
| **Steam P2P** | Not required | Uses Steam's relay network. Just works. |

<br>

**Key concepts:**

- **Authority model** - Each player is authoritative over their own units. Combat outcomes are decided by the target's game instance.
- **Transport abstraction** - Networking is abstracted behind `ITransport`, making it easy to swap between LiteNetLib (UDP) and Steam P2P.
- **Harmony patching** - The mod hooks into the game via [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) patches, intercepting and extending game methods at runtime.
- **State reconciliation** - Host broadcasts authoritative unit state; clients apply snap/lerp corrections in `StateApplier` to keep puppet units aligned.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement, feel free to open a PR.

### Getting set up

1. **Fork & clone** the repository.
2. **Install [BepInEx 5.4.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)** into your Sea Power game directory.
3. **Build:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build src/SeapowerMultiplayer.csproj /p:GameDir="<your Sea Power install path>"
   ```
4. The DLL is automatically copied to `BepInEx/plugins/` on successful build.

### Guidelines

- **Keep PRs small and focused.** One feature or one fix per PR. Large, sweeping changesets are hard to review and slow down the merge process. If your work touches multiple areas, split it into separate PRs.
- **Follow existing code style** and naming conventions.
- **Test in a live multiplayer session** before submitting. At minimum, verify your change works in a two-player session (host + client). Pay special attention to combat sync - missiles, air defence, carrier ops, and ground attacks are all areas where subtle issues can hide.
- **Open an issue first for large features** so we can discuss the approach before you invest time building it.
- **Document what you changed** in your PR description. Explain *what* and *why*, not just *how*.

### Testing

> A formal testing and benchmarking process is in the works. Until that's in place, the expectations below apply.

There is no automated test suite yet. Before submitting a PR, manually verify:

- Host and client can connect and sync a scenario.
- Your changes don't break existing combat sync.
- Performance is not noticeably degraded - watch for frame drops or network spikes, especially in high-unit-count scenarios.

If your change is in a specific area (e.g., flight ops, missile sync, damage states), test that area thoroughly across different time compression levels (1x, 5x, 10x).

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? [Open an issue](../../issues/new) with:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Whether you were host or client
- Time compression level, if relevant
- Any relevant log output from `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`

Or hop into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rMMnwJHc8w) and let us know.

<br>

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Mod not loading</b></summary>

Check that `BepInEx/` is in the correct location (same folder as `Sea Power.exe`) and that the plugin DLL is in `BepInEx/plugins/`. If you used the launcher, try closing and re-launching - the multiplayer overlay should appear in the top-right before you reach the main menu.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can't connect</b></summary>

Verify the host's IP and port are correct, and that the UDP port is open in the host's firewall/router. If using Steam P2P, make sure both players are friends on Steam and that Steam is running.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Desync or drift</b></summary>

The mod includes automatic drift detection and correction. If issues persist, either player can press **Ctrl+F10** to force a resync, or the host can re-send the scene via the Ctrl+F9 overlay.

</details>

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Workaround |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Aircraft cluster bombs deal no damage to ground units | Open | None - under investigation |
| Unit snaps back to original position on first order | Open | Move the waypoint slightly by dragging it on the map or cancel and re-issue the order |
| Carrier ops can desync at 10x+ time compression | Improved in 0.1.4 | Aircraft now use tiered drift correction. Use lower time compression if issues persist. |
| Position-targeted weapons don't sync (e.g., torpedoes/Tomahawks at a location) | Open | Target a unit instead of a position |
| Defensive missiles desync in high-missile scenarios | Fixed in 0.1.4 | Enemy air defence missiles no longer get purged. Missile position syncing removed for performance. |

<br>
